 Submission for assignment
The code reads conversations between a Recovery Agent and a Borrower and splits their messages.
It makes a summary of the conversation, including payment issues, reasons for default, solutions, and agreements.
It finds important actions like making partial payments or checking SMS for details.
It analyzes the tone of the messages (positive or negative) and puts everything into a simple report.
A  better apporach could be using a pretrained model / LLM but the instructions asked to not to do that.
